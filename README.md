# Java-Calculator
A simple calculator made in Java made by me.

## How it works?
It's really simple, if you are intrested look at the code.
I also tried to make it readable for others, but Im not sure if I did so

## Is this your first project in Java?
Yes it is, Im actually suprised as to how I wrote it.
I alredy know how to code in C#, C# .NET Framework (Visual Studio), C++ and Python, so I have some experience for coding, so that might be the reason why this code works :D
